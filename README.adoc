== Spring Cloud App Broker

Spring Cloud App Broker is a framework for building Spring Boot applications that implement the Open Service Broker API to deploy applications to a platform.

The Open Service Broker API project allows developers to deliver services to applications running within cloud native platforms such as Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and OpenShift.
Spring Cloud App Broker provides a framework based on Spring Boot that enables you to quickly create a service broker that deploys applications and services to the platform when managed services are provisioned.

Currently Cloud Foundry is supported as a target platform for service instance backing applications and services.

=== Getting Started

See the https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-app-broker/[project site] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-app-broker/docs/current/reference/[reference documentation] to get started building a service broker using this framework.

Take a look at this https://spring.io/blog/2019/05/30/introducing-spring-cloud-app-broker[introduction blog post] and to our https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/spring-cloud-app-broker-samples[sample apps].
