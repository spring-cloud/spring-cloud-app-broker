== Service Instances

You can configure the details of services, including applications to deploy, application deployment details, and backing services to create, in App Broker configuration properties. These properties are generally under `spring.cloud.appbroker.services`.

=== Configuring App Deployment

Deployment details for a backing application can be configured statically in the service broker's application configuration and dynamically by using service instance parameters and customization implementations.

==== Static Customization

You can statically configure backing application deployment details in the application configuration for the service broker by using properties under `spring.cloud.appbroker`.

===== Properties Configuration

You can specify application deployment properties in configuration. These properties can have default values and service-specific values.

For Cloud Foundry, you can set default values for all services under `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer.cloudfoundry.*`, as follows:

====
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      deployer:
        cloudfoundry:
          *properties:*
            *memory: 1G*
            *health-check: http*
            *health-check-http-endpoint: /health*
            *health-check-timeout: 180*
            *api-polling-timeout: 300*
----
====

You can set overriding values for a specific service in the service's configuration under `spring.cloud.appbroker.services.*`, as follows:

====
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      services:
        - service-name: example
          plan-name: standard

            - name: example-service-app1
              path: classpath:app1.jar
              *properties:*
                *memory: 2G*
                *count: 2*
                *no-route: true*

===== Environment Configuration

You can provide environment variables to be set on a deployed application. Environment variables are set by using properties under `environment` for the deployed application, as follows:

====
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      services:
        - service-name: example
          plan-name: standard
          apps:
            - name: example-service-app1
              path: classpath:app1.jar
              *environment:*
                *logging.level.spring.security: DEBUG*
                *spring.profiles.active: cloud*
----
====

===== Service Configuration

You can configure services that should be bound to a deployed application. Services are configured by using properties under `services` for the deployed application, as follows:

====
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      services:
        - service-name: example
          plan-name: standard
          apps:
            - name: example-service-app1
              path: classpath:app1.jar
              *services:*
              *- service-instance-name: example-db*
          *services:*
          *- service-instance-name: example-db*
            *name: mysql*
            *plan: small*
            *parameters:*
            *param-key: param-value*
----

==== Dynamic Customization

To customize the backing application deployment by using information that is only available when performing a service broker operation or that must be generated per service instance, you can use the service broker application configuration to provide the names of customization implementations.

===== Backing Application Target

You can configure the target location for backing applications (in Cloud Foundry, an org and space) using a `target` specification, as in the following example:

====
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      services:
        - service-name: example
          plan-name: standard
          *target:*
          *  name: SpacePerServiceInstance*
        apps:
          apps:
            - name: example-service-app1
              path: classpath:app1.jar
----
====

By default (if you do not provide a `target` specification), all backing applications are deployed to the default target specified under `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer`. For Cloud Foundry, this is the org named by `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer.cloudfoundry.default-org` and the space named by `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer.cloudfoundry.default-space`.

====== The `SpacePerServiceInstance` Target

If you use the `SpacePerServiceInstance` target, App Broker deploys backing applications to a unique target location that is named by using the service instance GUID provided by the platform at service instance create time. For Cloud Foundry, this target location is the org named by `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer.cloudfoundry.default-org`, and a new space is created by using the service instance GUID as the space name.

====== The `ServiceInstanceGuidSuffix` Target

If you use the `ServiceInstanceGuidSuffix` target, App Broker deploys backing applications by using a unique name and hostname that incorporates the service instance GUID provided by the platform at service instance create time. For Cloud Foundry, the target location is the org named by `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer.cloudfoundry.default-org`, the space named by `spring.cloud.appbroker.deployer.cloudfoundry.default-space`, and an application name as `[APP-NAME]-[SI-GUID]`, where `[APP-NAME]` is the `name` listed for the application under `spring.cloud.appbroker.services.apps` and `[SI-GUID]` is the service instance GUID. The application also uses a hostname that incorporates the service instance GUID as a suffix, as `[APP-NAME]-[SI-GUID]`.

====== Creating a Custom Target

If you want to create a custom Target, App Broker provides a flexible way to add new targets by creating a new `Bean` that extends from `TargetFactory` and implementing the `create` method, as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
public class CustomSpaceTarget extends TargetFactory<CustomSpaceTarget.Config> {

	public CustomSpaceTarget() {
		super(Config.class);
	}

	@Override
	public Target create(Config config) {
		return this::apply;
	}

	private ArtifactDetails apply(Map<String, String> properties, String name, String serviceInstanceId) {
		String space = "my-custom-space";
		properties.put(DeploymentProperties.TARGET_PROPERTY_KEY, space);

		return ArtifactDetails.builder()
			.name(name)
			.properties(properties)
			.build();
	}

	public static class Config {
	}

}
----
====

Once configured, we can specify in our service the new custom Target, as follows:

====
[source, yml, indent=0]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      services:
        - service-name: example
          plan-name: standard
          target:
            name: CustomSpaceTarget
----
====

===== Service Instance Parameters

When a user provides parameters while creating or updating a service instance, App Broker can transform these parameters into the details of the backing app deployment by using parameters transformers. You can configure parameters transformers by using properties under `parameters-transformers`, as follows:

====
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    appbroker:
      services:
        - service-name: example
          plan-name: standard
          apps:
            - name: example-service-app1
              path: classpath:app1.jar
              *parameters-transformers:*
                *- name: EnvironmentMapping*
                  *args:*
                    *- include: parameter1,parameter2*
                *- name: PropertyMapping*
                  *args:*
                    *- include: count,memory*
----
====

The named `parameters-transformers` refer to Java objects that have been contributed to the Spring application context. A parameters transformer can accept one or more arguments that configure its behavior and can modify any aspect of the backing application deployment (properties, environment variables, services, and so on).

====== The `EnvironmentMapping` Parameters Transformer

The `EnvironmentMapping` parameters transformer populates environment variables on the backing application from parameters provided when a service instance is created or updated. It supports a single argument, `include`, which specifies the names of parameters that are mapped to environment variables.

====== The `PropertyMapping` Parameters Transformer

The `PropertyMapping` parameters transformer sets deployment properties of the backing application from parameters provided when a service instance is created or updated. It supports a single argument, `include`, which specifies the names of deployment properties that should be recognized.

=== Creating a Service Instance

Spring Cloud App Broker provides the {sapbr-api}/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/workflow/instance/AppDeploymentCreateServiceInstanceWorkflow.html[`AppDeploymentCreateServiceInstanceWorkflow`] workflow, which handles deploying the configured backing applications and services, as illustrated in the previous sections. The service broker application can implement the {sapbr-api}/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/service/CreateServiceInstanceWorkflow.html[`CreateServiceInstanceWorkflow`] interface to further modify the deployment. Multiple workflows can be annotated with `@Order` so as to process the workflows in a specific order. Alternatively, the service broker application can implement the `ServiceInstanceService` interface provided by Spring Cloud Open Service Broker. See {scosb-docs}/#service-instances[Service Instances] in the {scosb-docs}/[Spring Cloud Open Service Broker documentation].

=== Updating a Service Instance

Spring Cloud App Broker provides the {sapbr-api}/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/workflow/instance/AppDeploymentUpdateServiceInstanceWorkflow.html[`AppDeploymentUpdateServiceInstanceWorkflow`] workflow, which handles updating the configured backing applications and services, as illustrated in the previous sections. If the list of backing services is updated, the default behavior is to create and bind the new backing service instances and to unbind and delete the existing backing service instances that are no longer listed in the configuration.

The service broker application can implement the {sapbr-api}/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/service/UpdateServiceInstanceWorkflow.html[`UpdateServiceInstanceWorkflow`] interface to further modify the deployment. Multiple workflows can be annotated with `@Order` so as to process the workflows in a specific order. Alternatively, the service broker application can implement the `ServiceInstanceService` interface provided by Spring Cloud Open Service Broker. See {scosb-docs}/#service-instances[Service Instances] in the {scosb-docs}/[Spring Cloud Open Service Broker documentation].

CAUTION: Modifying certain properties, such as disk and memory, when updating an application, may result in downtime.

=== Deleting a Service Instance

Spring Cloud App Broker provides the {sapbr-api}/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/workflow/instance/AppDeploymentDeleteServiceInstanceWorkflow.html[`AppDeploymentDeleteServiceInstanceWorkflow`] workflow, which handles deleting the configured backing applications and services, as illustrated in the previous sections. The service broker application can implement the {sapbr-api}/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/service/DeleteServiceInstanceWorkflow.html[`DeleteServiceInstanceWorkflow`] interface to further modify the deployment. Multiple workflows can be annotated with `@Order` so as to process the workflows in a specific order. Alternatively, the service broker application can implement the `ServiceInstanceService` interface provided by Spring Cloud Open Service Broker. See {scosb-docs}/#service-instances[Service Instances] in the {scosb-docs}/[Spring Cloud Open Service Broker documentation].

=== Persisting Service Instance State

Spring Cloud App Broker provides the {sapbr-api}/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/state/ServiceInstanceStateRepository.html[`ServiceInstanceStateRepository`] interface for persisting service instance state. The default implementation is {sapbr-api}/org/springframework/cloud/appbroker/state/InMemoryServiceInstanceStateRepository.html[`InMemoryServiceInstanceStateRepository`], which uses an in memory `Map` to save state and offers an easy getting-started experience. To use a proper database for persisting state, you can implement `ServiceInstanceStateRepository` in your application.

WARNING: The `InMemoryServiceInstanceStateRepository` is provided for demonstration and testing purposes only. It is not suitable for production applications!

==== Example Implementation

The following example shows a service instance state repository implementation:

====
[source,java,%autofit]
----
include::{examples-dir}/ExampleServiceInstanceStateRepository.java[]
----
====

One option for persisting service instance state is to use a Spring Data `CrudRepository`. The following example shows a `ReactiveCrudRepository` implementation:

====
[source,java,%autofit]
----
include::{examples-dir}/ServiceInstanceStateCrudRepository.java[]
----
====

A model object is necessary for persisting data with a `CrudRepository`. The following example shows a `ServiceInstance` model:
====
